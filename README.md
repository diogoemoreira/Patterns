# Patterns
Example of some Patterns used in programming

Facade Pattern is not well implemented because the idea of turning it into a game interface kinda made it hard to implement the pattern (might do another one in the future)

Template -> You create an Abstract Class and the classes that extend to it only change the methods that they want to change (I think its too easy to make an example out of it)
