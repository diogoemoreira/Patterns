# Patterns
Example of some Patterns used in programming

Facade Pattern is not well implemented because the idea of making it into a game kinda made it hard to implement the pattern (might do another one in the future)

Template -> You create an Abstract Class and the classes that extend to it only change the methods that they want to change (too easy to make an example out of it)
